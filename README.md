# DA_Capstone_project

### Project Overview:
This project focused on analyzing road accident data across India from 2003 to 2016, providing insights into accident trends, fatalities, and injuries. The analysis covered various dimensions such as vehicle type, time of day, lane types, and accident causes, enabling a comprehensive understanding of road safety issues in India. The data was sourced from multiple datasets, each with state-wise accident statistics.

### Key Tasks and Findings:
- **Task 1-7**: We calculated state-wise accident percentages, identifying the states with the highest and lowest accidents, and determining the mean accidents per lane type (single, double, triple, four lanes). This helped in understanding accident distribution across states and road types.
- **Task 8-13**: We analyzed accident-related injuries and fatalities, calculating the number of accidents, injuries, and deaths for each lane type per 1 lakh population. This highlighted the risks associated with different road structures and accident severity.
- **Task 14-23**: The analysis shifted to understanding the causes of accidents, such as driver fault, pedestrian errors, road defects, and weather conditions. By normalizing the data per 1 lakh population, we identified major risk factors contributing to accidents.
- **Task 24-27**: We explored the number of accidents and fatalities based on vehicle types (two-wheelers, cars, buses, trucks). Additionally, we analyzed the number of accidents occurring during day and night in 2014 and 2016, revealing time-specific accident trends.

### Challenges and Solutions:
- **Data Gaps and Cleaning**: Some datasets had missing or inconsistent data. We cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Data Structure Variability**: The datasets had different structures; we aligned and processed them for consistent analysis.
- **Column Name Discrepancies**: We ensured correct mapping of column names to avoid errors during calculations.

### Conclusion:
This project provided a detailed examination of road safety in India, revealing critical insights into accident causes, time-based patterns, and the impact of road and vehicle types on accident severity. By thoroughly analyzing the data, we were able to identify key risk factors and trends that can guide road safety improvements and policy decisions. The comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of structured data handling and statistical interpretation for meaningful insights.
